##Brief of history
I think you're going to ask: *"Why has the game been developed that way? There is plenty of game engines ready to use based on WebGl."*.

Well, let's start from beginning. At first, It was supposed to be a pure CSS3 animation. This idea was born just after the **[PNG-TO-CSS library](https://github.com/marcinwieprzkowicz/png-to-css)**.

When I saw the final result I was really impressed. I thought to myself, why not to make the game? I shared the idea with my friends from work. Natalia said she likes the idea and can help. As you can see in the demo map is absolutely fantastic.

One day, Dawid asked if I checked the game on iPad. Well, I did not. Since that day, I learned how to optimize website for iPad ;).

Development took me a long time, it was my activity after hours. Optimization, sounds, finding solutions, etc., it was all on my head. I consider this project more as an experiment than a game. In the future I plan to write this game again, this time using WebGl.

P.S. There is a reason why I didn't use ready-made solutions. I wanted to improve my own skills :).


##Issues
The game is still **unfinished** and has a few issues that has to be solved.
* performance: moving platforms eats more CPU than your mother
* performance under iPad
* touchmove event: unhandled
* the map is static: templates?
* ...and so on
